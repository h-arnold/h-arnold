# Hey there! Welcome to My GitHub Profile

## About Me

I'm the Head of Computer Science and Digital Technology at a large secondary school in Wales. With a background in primary teaching, I've spent my career finding genuinely impactful ways of integrating technology into the classroom, from EYFS to KS5. I love automating the boring stuff to make room for the fun bits. Big fan of micro:bits for bringing code to life in the classroom. Also, I've worked with some well-known educational publishers to develop curriculum content and train fellow educators.

## Featured Projects

- **Google Slides Assessor**  
  A tool that uses Large Language Models to grade student work submitted via Google Slides, checking for completeness, accuracy, and key concepts. Actively in development, with plans to integrate features from Assessment Bot.  
  [Check it out here](https://github.com/h-arnold/google-slides-assessor)

- **Assessment Bot**  
  My first experiment with LLM-based assessment. It marks Google Forms submissions, provides feedback, and generates a DiRT sheet & heatmap. While no longer actively developed, key features will be incorporated into Google Slides Assessor.

- **Handy Google Apps Scripts**  
  A collection of quick-and-dirty scripts that automate tedious admin tasks. Includes scripts for batch-generating student feedback reports, automating Google Classroom tasks, and streamlining spreadsheet data handling.

- **Micro:bit Physical Computing Projects**  
  A collection of hands-on micro:bit tasks designed for Year 5-7 students, making coding tangible through real-world applications.  
  [Check it out here](https://github.com/h-arnold/y7-microbit-tasks)

- **Year 10 Pentesting Practicals**  
  Resources to get GCSE students (14-16 years old) into penetration testing, aligning with Unit 1.4 of the OCR J277 GCSE spec. Designed to give students a taste of using real (if old) pen-testing tools while ensuring network security, each task runs from a bootable USB stick. This helps ensure that you retain complete control over potentially damaging tools at all times.

- **QuakeJS Setup Guide**  
  Step-by-step guide to running QuakeJS on a local server. Because who doesn't love a bit of retro gaming?

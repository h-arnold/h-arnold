# Hey there! 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile

## About Me 🏫

I’m the Head of Computer Science and Digital Technology at a large secondary school in Wales. From EYFS to A‑Level (KS5), I automate the boring stuff so teachers and students can get on with the fun stuff. A serial starter—and-occastional-finisher—of projects that solve real problems, I build production-ready, open-source tools that bridge pedagogy and engineering: micro:bits for hands-on learning, cloud and command-line workflows (TypeScript/JavaScript/Google Apps Script, Python), containerisation (Docker), and lightweight data and CI/CD solutions. I also collaborate with educational publishers to develop curriculum and train colleagues.

## 📋 Featured Projects

- **📝 Assessment Bot**  
  A privacy-first tool that automates formative assessment by pulling student work (Google Slides or Sheets) from Google Classroom, scoring Completeness, Accuracy and SPaG (0–5), and producing heatmaps and reports so teachers can quickly identify where to intervene. Student PII is processed only within the school's Google Workspace and the backend is ephemeral and stateless.

- **🗄️ JsonDbApp**  
  Zero-dependency document DB in Google Apps Script that stores serialisable data in Drive. Supports Mongo-like CRUD on named collections and uses a ScriptProperties-based master index to keep consistency and minimise API calls. Perfect for small to medium Apps Script projects that need structured data storage without the overhead and compliance issues of third-party databases.

- **🏗️ WIP - Python Exercise Generator and Distributor**  
  In dire need of a snappier name — a teaching platform for secondary-school programming that keeps everything in the browser: students complete exercises inside Jupyter notebooks, run code inline, and get autograding feedback. Teachers can generate new exercises quickly and bundle selected exercises into GitHub Classroom template repos.

- **🧪 Interactive Tech Modelling Tools**  
  A repository with links to the various interactive tools I've created for teaching concepts such as password cracking, DoS attacks and the difference between fixed and variable width records. All were hastily vibe-coded with Gemini — if you want to work on them, I wish you the best of luck and Godspeed!

- **⚡ Handy Google Apps Scripts**  
  A collection of quick-and-dirty scripts that automate tedious admin tasks. Includes scripts for batch-generating student feedback reports, automating Google Classroom tasks, and streamlining spreadsheet data handling.  
  Check them out in my repos below. 👇

- **🎛️ Micro:bit Physical Computing Projects**  
  A collection of hands-on micro:bit tasks designed for Year 5–7 students, making coding tangible through real-world applications.
